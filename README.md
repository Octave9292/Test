# *A simple introduction to creative computing*

Software, computing tools are the antipode of my usually work. I am completely lost when I can't work with physical materials as paint, paper, stones... etc. When I started to delve into the creative computing, I was disoriented among the tutorials, the vocabulary, the electric components, the led, the wire, the softwares. As I was trying to understand all of this, I didn't have time to think about ideas, prototypes that I could make using these really new medias for me. At one point, I just decided to use my difficulties to understand of the whole creative computing universe as a final outcome/idea. I was going in a circle, trying, failing, not understanding, it was really fustrating and that was that feeling that i wanted to represent, to recreate. Then, I decided to recreate one of these tutorials, from Tinkercard or from Paul McWorther's videos. My tutorial had to be almost impossible, using the most specific terms and with an infinite amount of steps. 
Despite my computing reluctance, I managed to understand the basics of how leds and the circuit in kits are working. 

**Follow steps by steps this simple tutorial to light 3 LEDS on a bread board thanks to the Arduino UNO board**

1- Take the USB cable from your kit and plug it in your laptop

2- Plug the other extremity in your Arduino UNO board

3- Now take the bread board from your kit
4- Connect a wire from the 5v port of your Arduino UNO board to one of the negative ports of the bread board
5- Connect a wire from the GND port of your Arduino UNO board to the positive port next to the previous connexion
6- Connect a RGB LED in the e21 port to the e18 port
7- Connect a green LED in the f27 port and in the f25
8- Connect a yellow LED in the e7 port and in the e9
9- Connect a resistor in the b21 port and in the d21
10- Connect a resistor in the b20 port and in the d20
11- Connect a resistor in the b19 port and in the d19
12- Connect a resistor in the b9 port and in the d9 port
13- Connect a resistor in the g25 port and in the i25 port
14- Connect a wire from from the upper left negative port to the upper right negative port
15- Connect a wire from the ~9 port of your Arduino UNO board to the a21 port of your bread board
16- Connect a wire from the ~10 port of your Arduino UNO board to the a20 port of your bread board
17- Connect a wire from the ~11 port of your Arduino UNO board to the a18 port of your bread board
18- Connect a wire from the ~6 port of your Arduino UNO board to the i27 port of your bread board
19- Connect a wire from the a30 port to the right 22th negative port
20- Connect a wire from the c30 port to the i2 port
21- Connect a wire from the d30 port to the a14 port
22- Connect a wire from the i30 port to the 10th left negative port
23- Connect a wire from the 30th right positive port to the 22th positive port
24- Connect a wire from the 28th left positive port to the a7 port 
25- Connect a wire from the b28 port to the g19 port
26- Connect a wire from the c26 port to the g11 port
27- Connect a wire from the e26 port to the 13th left positive port
28- Connect a wire from the j25 port to the 22th right positive port
29- Connect a wire from the a24 port to the f22 port
30- Connect a wire from the
