# *A simple introduction to creative computing*

Software, computing tools and digital interfaces are the opposite of my usual work. I am completely lost when I can't work with physical materials as paint, paper, stones... When I started to delve into the creative computing, I was disoriented among the tutorials, the vocabulary, the electric components, the LEDS, the wires, the softwares. As I was trying to understand all of these, I realised that I didn't have time to think about ideas, prototypes that I could make using these new medias. At one point, I just decided to use my misunderstandings of the whole creative computing universe as a final outcome/idea. I was going in a circle, trying, failing, not understanding, it was really fustrating and that was that feeling that i wanted to represent, to recreate. Then, I decided to remake one of these tutorials, from Tinkercard or from Paul McWorther's videos. My tutorial had to be almost impossible, using the most specific terms and with an infinite amount of steps. 
Despite my computing reluctance, I managed to understand the basics of how leds and the circuit in kits are working with the help of a classmate.

**Follow steps by steps this simple tutorial to light 3 LEDS on a bread board**

1- Take the USB cable from your kit and plug it in your laptop

2- Plug the other extremity in your Arduino UNO board

3- Now take the bread board from your kit

4- Connect a wire from the 5v port of your Arduino UNO board to one of the negative ports of the bread board

5- Connect a wire from the GND port of your Arduino UNO board to the positive port next to the previous connexion

6- Connect a RGB LED in the e21 port to the e18 port

7- Connect a green LED in the f27 port and in the f25

8- Connect a yellow LED in the e7 port and in the e9

9- Connect a resistor in the b21 port and in the d21

10- Connect a resistor in the b20 port and in the d20

11- Connect a resistor in the b19 port and in the d19

12- Connect a resistor in the b9 port and in the d9 port

13- Connect a resistor in the g25 port and in the i25 port

14- Connect a wire from from the upper left negative port to the upper right negative port

15- Connect a wire from the ~9 port of your Arduino UNO board to the a21 port of your bread board

16- Connect a wire from the ~10 port of your Arduino UNO board to the a20 port of your bread board

17- Connect a wire from the ~11 port of your Arduino UNO board to the a18 port of your bread board

18- Connect a wire from the ~6 port of your Arduino UNO board to the i27 port of your bread board

19- Connect a wire from the a30 port to the right 22th negative port

20- Connect a wire from the c30 port to the i2 port

21- Connect a wire from the d30 port to the a14 port

22- Connect a wire from the i30 port to the 10th left negative port

23- Connect a wire from the 30th right positive port to the 22th positive port

24- Connect a wire from the 28th left positive port to the a7 port 

25- Connect a wire from the b28 port to the g19 port

26- Connect a wire from the c26 port to the g11 port

27- Connect a wire from the e26 port to the 13th left positive port

28- Connect a wire from the j25 port to the 22th right positive port

29- Connect a wire from the a24 port to the f22 port

30- Connect a wire from the j20 port to the j1 port

31- Connect a wire from the 19th left port to the f1 port

32- Connect a wire from the g17 port to the f4 port

33- Connect a wire from the d15 port to the e1 port

*Reference*

This wweek, I didn't have the time to look as much as the other workshops for references. However, I had some artists in mind that were using LEDS technologies for their artworks. I saw the work of Dan Flavin in an art gallery last year in Paris. This artist used to work with fluorescent light tubes, making sculptures with this unusual media in large empty rooms. I really liked how the lights and the colors in his work reverberate in the rooms and blend together.
